>[!Note]
>It is a revision of the [Original Drift Keyboard](https://github.com/Timception/Drift) using Vial-QMK firmware.\
>The frame and outer parts of the previous version will all fit on this version as all the screw holes are in the same positions.\
>However, the PCB is slightly expanded around the microcontroller area due to it being more populated.
