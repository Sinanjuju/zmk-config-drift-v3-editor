## Drift Keyboard V3 (by Timception)
This is the wireless ZMK version of the [Original Drift Keyboard](https://github.com/Timception/Drift)  

This version of the Drift Keyboard supports 5-Pin Cherry MX switches, Kailh Choc V1 and Kailh Choc V2 switches, yep, not 2 but 3 different switches all on the same pcb - However, the PCB is not open source so you will have to contact me if you would like a pair.

>[!Note]
>The frame and outer parts of the previous version (Drift Keyboard V2) will all fit on this version.  
>However, the PCB is slightly expanded around the microcontroller area due to it being more populated.
