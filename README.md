## Drift Keyboard V3 (by Timception)  

- This is the wireless [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) version of the [Original Drift Keyboard](https://github.com/Timception/Drift)  

  - The Drift V3 can also be [wired](https://github.com/Timception/Drift-Keyboard-V3-Wired-Vial-Version) by changing the MCU  

  - The PCB is not open source, but you could [contact me](https://www.instagram.com/majin.keyboards) if you would like a pair
